"add page" you then want delete the bit in the second box that should say www.github.com etc and type in "javascript:" 
(without the " bit) then (in the first box) name it something like "popcat hack" it doesn't mattter what you call it though.
then go onto popcat.click and click on the bookmark and it should start clicking for you!
